# waste-classification-DL

A deep learning project designed to classify waste into six categoriesâ€”cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash to promote smart recycling and efficient waste management. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the TrashNet dataset for high accuracy and real-world applicability.This solution supports smarter, more sustainable recycling systems, contributing to reducing landfill waste and enhancing environmental sustainability.
